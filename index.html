       <p>This was my first project before my coding education even started. My goal was to create a guide to help me study as I go about my course work. It has a few errors, mainly the index.html not being in the root file. However aside from that I would consider it a success for a novice.</p>

       <p>This was my first proper work assignment for my bootcamp. I primarily just cleaned up the code and made everything a little neater.</p>
